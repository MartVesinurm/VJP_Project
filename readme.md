## Verkkojulkaisemisen perusteet - course's final project

This is a simple game project made for Aalto University course.

**Game idea** is to repair potholes that emerge to road before cars run over them.
To get to the next level player has to repair enough many potholes to score points.
Player loses the game if s/he gets ran over by a car or too many cars run over potholes.
To help player's task game spawns powerups. Game has been developed using **Javascript** and Phaser libraries.
Game is in Finnish. Enjoy the game!
